# 🌟 Welcome to the Code Carnival! 🌟

Hey there! I'm just a rookie developer on an adventurous journey to uncover the secrets of the coding universe. 🚀 I'm like a kid in a candy store, trying out different tech candies to see which ones I like the most! 🍬

### Tech I'm Currently Juggling:

- 🐳 Docker: I'm all aboard the containerization hype train! (Please don't ask if I've sunk any containers yet. 😅)
- 💻 VM's: Virtual Machines – because one OS just isn't enough! (I need at least 10 more screens for them)
- 🐧 Linux: I speak penguin and love the freedom it brings to my development world!

### Fluent in Coding Languages:

- ☕ Java: My morning coffee; it's just the right blend of caffeine and code!
- 🐍 Python: The friendly snake that helps me slither through complex problems!

### Currently Learning:

- 💥 Assembly: Yep, I'm getting down to the nitty-gritty of things. My computer talks in zeroes and ones, and I'm here to listen!
- 🧩 C++ / C: Because who doesn't enjoy a good puzzle? 🕵️‍♂️

### Fun Fact About Me:

Apart from coding and building applications, I enjoy a bit of chaos. I'm the sort who'd attempt to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded – and maybe succeed once in a blue moon. 🙃 So, I dabble in CTFs (Capture The Flag) and try to crack vulnerable machines to snag that elusive flag! 🔓🚩

### My Latest Obsession:

Right now, I'm diving into the mesmerizing world of reverse engineering! It's like trying to decode the secrets of an ancient manuscript, except it's with software. The feeling is somewhere between Sherlock Holmes and a hacker on a caffeine high! 🔍💻

So, whether I'm breaking things apart or putting them together, I'm always up for an adventure in the realm of code! Feel free to join me on this crazy coding rollercoaster. Let's learn, break, and build together! 🎢🚀
